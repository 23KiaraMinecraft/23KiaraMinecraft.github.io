    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>My name is Kenneth Toland and I am 18 years old. I am a senior at Kettering Fairmont High School and I love
        reading books and playing video games. Reading books, be it physical or digital, is one of my favorite things to
        do in my free time. I have even started creating some of my own stories on a website called Wattpad. I love
        playing sandbox and open-world games, especially ones with a lot of side quests and post-game content. I also
        like to play games that can be modded to add more challenges to the experience or to make the game easier. When
        it comes to horror games, there are many that i won't play myself and instead will watch Youtubers play them,
        but I do love to play the Five Nights at Freddy's games. My favorite animals are wolves, foxes, and dogs. I have
        travelled to Florida for a vacation and got to visit SeaWolrd and Universal Studios. I like to listen to a rap
        songs and some other types of music that relates to my favorite games. I love to go to the Kettering Rec Center,
        specifically the water areas, to have fun during the summer. I also like to play Yu-Gi-Oh games and have
        collected Yu-Gi-Oh cards. My favorite anime is My Hero Academia. I have started to get into reading manga as
        well.</p>
